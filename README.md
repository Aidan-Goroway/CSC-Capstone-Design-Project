The programming component of my Capstone project was a tool that provided dynamic feedback for execution errors of fighting game motion inputs. 
The tool was made with the Unity game engine, which uses C# scripts.
There are 2 builds of the project, a "feedback build" and a "no-feedback build". 
The C# script for the former has been included in this repository, as well the completed research paper and poster for the project.
The tool was used to run a between-subject experiment of my own design, extensive details of which can be found in the research paper.
The rest of the project, including the Unity files and both runnable builds, can be found on a Google Drive linked to from this respository.

The reason why the project is not included here like my other repositories is because it is simply too large. Even zipped, the folder is 877 MB.
Unzipped, "Thesis Work" is 2.91 GB and contains 46,846 files.
Along with the zipped file containing all of the work, the Google Drive also includes 2 videos in their own zipped file: 
1) the video presentation for my completed project, and
2) the video my experiment participants were each shown prior to the start of their individual trials.
